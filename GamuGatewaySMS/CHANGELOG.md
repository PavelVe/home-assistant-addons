# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [1.2.3] - 2025-01-19

### Fixed
- **Text Field Clearing** - Both phone number and message fields now clear reliably after sending
- **Field Validation** - Better handling of empty fields with detailed logging for debugging
- **UI Synchronization** - Improved clearing of both internal state and UI fields

### Changed
- **SMSC Configuration Removed** - No longer needed since REST API logic works without it
- **Enhanced Logging** - SMS logs now show full message text instead of truncated version
- **Better Error Messages** - Field validation shows exact current values for debugging

### Removed
- SMSC Number configuration field (no longer needed)
- SMSC fallback mechanism (simplified to use Location 1 like REST API)

## [1.2.2] - 2025-01-19

### Fixed
- **MQTT/Button SMS Logic** - Now uses same SMSC handling as REST API for consistency
- **SMSC Location Method** - MQTT sending now uses `{'Location': 1}` when no SMSC configured (same as REST API)
- **Simplified SMSC Resolution** - Removed complex fallback that was different from REST API behavior

### Changed
- MQTT Publisher now uses identical SMSC logic as REST API endpoints
- Consistent SMS sending behavior across both REST API and MQTT/Button interfaces
- Simplified logging for SMSC source identification

## [1.2.1] - 2025-01-19

### Added
- **SMSC Configuration** - New optional "SMSC Number" field in addon configuration
- **Smart SMSC Priority** - Uses configured SMSC ‚Üí SIM SMSC ‚Üí fallback (in that order)
- **Multi-language Support** - Added SMSC field to both Czech and English translations

### How to fix Code 69 error:
1. Go to addon Configuration
2. Add your operator's SMSC number in "SMSC Number" field:
   - T-Mobile CZ: `+420603052000`
   - Vodafone CZ: `+420724000000`
   - O2 CZ: `+420602909090`
3. Restart addon
4. Try sending SMS again

### Technical Details:

- **State Consistency** - UI and internal state now always match

### Changed
