### Added

#### SMS Sending Enhancements (MQTT/REST)
- **Automatic Unicode Detection** - When sending SMS via MQTT, the addon now automatically detects whether the message contains non-ASCII characters (such as diacritics like h√°ƒçky and ƒç√°rky). When detected, Unicode mode is automatically enabled, ensuring proper delivery of messages with special characters.
- MQTT method intelligently switches encoding based on message content
- REST API remains unchanged with explicit `unicode` parameter control for backward compatibility

#### SMS Counter & Cost Tracking
- **Persistent SMS Sent Counter** - New sensor `sms_gateway_sent_count` tracks total number of SMS messages sent through the addon (via both MQTT and REST API)
- Counter state persists across addon restarts using JSON file storage at `/data/sms_counter.json`
- Counter increments automatically on every successful SMS send operation
- **Optional Cost Tracking Sensor** - New configuration option `sms_cost_per_message` (default: 0.0) enables SMS cost monitoring
- When set to non-zero value, creates `sms_gateway_total_cost` sensor displaying cumulative cost of all sent messages
- **Configurable Currency** - New `sms_cost_currency` configuration field for customizing cost display (EUR, USD, CZK, etc.)
- **Reset Counter Button** - New MQTT button `sms_gateway_reset_counter` for easy one-click reset of SMS counter and total costs back to zero

#### SIM Card SMS Management
- **Automatic SMS Deletion** - New configuration option `auto_delete_read_sms` (default: false) automatically deletes SMS messages from SIM card after they are read during monitoring cycle
- Helps prevent SIM card storage exhaustion on cards with limited SMS capacity
- **Delete All SMS Button** - New MQTT button `sms_gateway_delete_all_sms` for bulk deletion of all SMS messages stored on SIM card
- **New REST Endpoint** - Added `DELETE /sms/deleteall` endpoint for programmatic deletion of all SMS messages via REST API
- **Automatic Capacity Refresh** - SMS storage capacity sensor automatically updates after both manual deletion (via button) and automatic deletion operations

#### Modem Diagnostics & Information
- **Enhanced Modem Information Sensors** - New diagnostic sensors providing detailed hardware information:
  - **Modem IMEI** - International Mobile Equipment Identity number
  - **Modem Manufacturer** - Device manufacturer name
  - **Modem Model** - Specific device model identification
  - **SIM IMSI** - International Mobile Subscriber Identity from inserted SIM card
- **SMS Storage Capacity Sensor** - New sensor `sms_gateway_sms_storage_used` displaying number of SMS messages currently stored on SIM card
- Includes full capacity details in sensor attributes (SIMUsed, SIMSize, PhoneUsed, PhoneSize, TemplatesUsed)
- Displayed unit: "messages" with icon `mdi:email-multiple`
- **New REST Endpoints** for modem information:
  - `GET /status/modem` - Retrieve modem hardware information (IMEI, manufacturer, model, firmware version)
  - `GET /status/sim` - Get SIM card information (IMSI number)
  - `GET /status/sms_capacity` - Query SMS storage capacity and current usage statistics

### Enhanced
- **Counter Integration** - Both MQTT and REST API methods increment the SMS counter automatically on successful message transmission
- **MQTT Discovery** - Extended Home Assistant MQTT discovery with all new sensors and buttons for seamless integration
- **Persistent Storage** - SMS counter and cost data survives addon restarts and updates

### Configuration
- `sms_cost_per_message` (float, default: 0.0) - Price per SMS message for cost tracking (set to 0 to disable cost sensor)
- `sms_cost_currency` (string, default: "CZK") - Currency code for cost display (EUR, USD, CZK, GBP, etc.)
- `auto_delete_read_sms` (bool, default: false) - Enable automatic deletion of SMS after reading during monitoring

###  Extended Device Support
- Added `/dev/ttyUSB2`, `/dev/ttyUSB3`, and `/dev/ttyS0` to supported device paths for broader
  hardware compatibility

### Technical Details
- Added `detect_unicode_needed()` function using ASCII encoding check to determine if Unicode mode is required
- Created `SMSCounter` class with JSON-based persistent storage mechanism
- MQTT Unicode handling: uses explicit `unicode` parameter if provided, otherwise performs automatic detection
- SMS counter data published to `{topic_prefix}/sms_counter/state` as JSON: `{"count": N, "cost": X.XX}`
- Modem information published on addon startup and available via REST API endpoints
- Auto-delete functionality integrated into SMS monitoring loop when enabled
- SMS storage capacity automatically refreshed after deletion operations to reflect current state

## [1.3.0] - 2025-08-21

### Fixed
- **MQTT Unicode Support** - Fixed MQTT SMS sending to properly handle Unicode messages
- MQTT method now respects `"unicode": true` parameter in JSON payload (was previously ignored)
